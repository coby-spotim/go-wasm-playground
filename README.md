# WebAssembly Playground

I've been investigating trying to learn frontend development recently, but I haven't really fallen in love with JavaScript like everyone says they do... so I decided to try and see if I can figure out the whole WebAssembly thing, and maybe create some frontend code using Go, which is a language that I've been using a lot recently.

Here, you will find any random playground stuff to see what capabilities Go has for WebAssembly.
